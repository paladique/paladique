### Jasmine Greenaway aka @paladique üëãüèø

Hello! Welcome to my GitHub. I'm a NYC (Brooklyn!) based developer working in developer relations. I also teach web development as a part time lecturer. Most of my work is focused on beginners and students, but I also enjoy building samples of all levels! Most of my work has been built with .NET and/or JavaScript. Outside of my work, I like to dabble - currently, I'm spending a lot of time learning Python and data science.

### FAQ

‚ùì Where's your handle from? 

I'm a huge [fantasy RPG](https://www.baldursgate.com/) (swords/armor/magic/etc stuff) video game fan, my handle is a play on the "paladin", which is a kind of knight that generally fights evil and a class I usually will play or pick when gaming. Most paladins are [Lawful Good](https://www.gamersdecide.com/articles/dnd-alignments-explained), but personally, I'd say I'm Chaotic Good.

‚ùì How did you get into coding?

Before my family household had internet (early 00s), I would use the [Corel](https://www.corel.com/en/all-products/) suite to make silly presentations. We eventually got internet and I used [Geocities](https://www.howtogeek.com/692445/remembering-geocities-the-1990s-precursor-to-social-media/) to put them on a website, and built more websites on random things for fun and I eventually got into customizing my MySpace and LiveJournal. I didn't see coding as a career until my second year in [undergrad](https://erau.edu/degrees/bachelor/software-engineering), and then I switched majors to Software Engineering. I started my career as an intern with writing in ASP.NET, VB.NET, and Cold Fusion, then moved to C# and ASP.NET MVC, where I was introduced to jQuery which was how I was introduced to JavaScript. 

‚ùì I have another question, where can I ask?
